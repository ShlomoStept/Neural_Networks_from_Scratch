## Get started
You can set up the environment with all dependencies like so:
```
conda create --name NN-FS python=3.8
conda activate NN-FS
pip install numpy pandas
```

## High-Level structure
* Paper: Explores in more detail the core mathematics of the neural network.
* data: MNIST Dataset of handwritten digits
* model: Simple 3-Layer Neural Network

## How to Run


1. Please download the python or jupyter-notebook file and the mnist_data folder with all the files

2. Then either run the cells of jupyter notebook or run the python file using 
  ```
  python Neural_Network_from_Scratch.py
  ```
